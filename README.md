# Communication-Efficient Federated DNN Training in Three Steps: Convert, Compress, Correct

The Huffman compression can improve the compression rate but not influence the model convergence(classification accuracy), so this source code only includes the fp convertion and error-correction.

There are several compression scheme in this code.
## CO3 Algorithm

## Count Sketch

## Tinyscript
